Hello, this is the landing page for your personal website!

Go ahead and play with the file named `index.md`.

Try adding an image using the following syntax:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- This is how you embed an image using markdown -->
![The first father](http://octodex.github.com/images/founding-father.jpg)
{% endhighlight %}

Or you can go to the Posts section, look at the first post to see how to create your own.

Why don't you tell us about yourself?
